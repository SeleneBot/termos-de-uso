Privacy Statements for Selene

Message and data collection from Selene:

Message data such as content and members are checked and stored for the grading system. This data is unreadable for humans and therefore we never verify it. The only message number is reserved. Other data such as content, member, guild and others are temporarily cached for commands such as user and server information. Many other commands use this data.

Selene Membership and Presence Data Collection: Presence data such as online status is stored in an unreadable cache, used in specific commands to display presence information. Other data such as activity, member updates (for presence data) and others are NOT collected, stored or shared in any way.

Selene Server Member List Data Collection: Server members can have valuable data. That's why it's a Privileged Intent on the Discord developer portal. This data is used in the bot, logging, general commands and more. This intent also provides us with user updates, such as when a user joined or left a server and other updates. We use this to create welcome and farewell messages on a server. This feature is configurable using the commands in the util category as another data record. This data is stored in an unreadable cache, but also sent in some messages publicly. We DO NOT share massive and valuable data with anyone and it is stored and contained in the bot.

Selene event data collection:

Intents allow the developer to manipulate event data. By default, they are all enabled, which means we will receive all events provided by the Discord gateway. This data can provide a wide range of information in large amounts. If you want to see this, we have a logging feature, making it easy for server admins to see who did what. For example, who deletes a message? What was the message about? That kind of thing. Since this information is sensitive, it can be disabled using setLogChannel and setting it to none. When this option is enabled, data is cached and sent to the specified channel and is never sent anywhere else.

Rating system data:

Our leveling system saves message count and command count in our leveling system. We keep only message id and server id which are just used to fetch them for further purpose like sort command or sort table. These IDs are useless on their own and are not private. Note that this data is stored in a local database. This database is private, but the information there is useless, as I said before.

Other data:

We mention all confidential and valuable data here. Other data is likely stored in an unreadable cache, so you can rest easy with other items we haven't mentioned.

Anyway, thanks for using Selene.
